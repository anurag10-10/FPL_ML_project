# Fantasy Premier League Player Position Predictor

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the positions of football players based on their Fantasy Premier League (FPL) statistics. The model is trained on historical FPL data and can be used to identify players potentially playing out of their listed positions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration of FPL statistics
- Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms for position prediction
- Feature importance analysis
- Prediction of player positions for the current season
- Identification of players potentially playing out of position

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
